# Repository of Labs-Hardel
Hardel's lab offers tools that allow the creation of datapacks without any knowledge of programming and datapacks.

## Website :
The site is freely accessible to all at the following address:  
https://labs.hardel.io

### Beta of Hardel's Lab :
To try unstable features in advance, there is a link accessible to all.  
https://beta-labs.hardel.io

**WARNING !**  
There are several elements to know all these features are in an experimental bute.  
It is extremely and strongly recommended not to create any concrete datapack project with the Beta version, this site exists only to test new features.

- The data can be regularly erased and reset.
- The data are not the same as the production version.
- Accounts can be deleted.
